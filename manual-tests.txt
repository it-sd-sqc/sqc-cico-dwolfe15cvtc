Use `./build.sh` to build CiCo and `./run.sh` to run it if using the command line. You can otherwise use your IDE to build and run CiCo.

# Module 4-7: Ticket 401 - Non-Numeric Input Filtering

## Test steps
1. Build and run CiCo.
2. Type "abcd" into the card number field.
3. Wait 11 seconds.

## Expected results:
*  The card number field should ignore non-numeric characters. If no numeric input is provided, the field should remain empty.

# Module 5-8: Ticket 501: Add Manual Proceed Button After Scanning

## Test Steps
1. Launch the CiCo application.
2. Scan a valid card.
3. Observe the status update screen.
4. Wait for the timeout to return to the main screen.
5. Restart the application.
6. Scan a valid card.
7. Click the new "Proceed" button instead of waiting.
8. Observe the status update screen transition immediately back to the main screen.

## Expected Results
* The new "Proceed" button should allow users to bypass the timeout and return to the main screen immediately.
* If the button is not clicked, the timeout should still function as before.

# Module 6-8: Ticket 601
Remove Enter or Procced Button and automate the task after entering a valid id.

## Test Steps

1.Build and run CiCo.

2.Type exactly 8 digits "00000000" into the card field.

3.Return to main screen (wait for timeout).

4.Type 7 digits "0000000", pause, then type the 8th digit.

## Expected Results
The Enter button should not be present in the UI.

The status panel should automatically appear after entering the 8th digit in step 2.

After step 4, the system should immediately process the card when the 8th digit is entered.
